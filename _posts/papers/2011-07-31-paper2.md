*Black, J. A., White, B., Viner, R. M., & Simmons, R. K.* (2013). 
**Bariatric surgery for obese children and adolescents: 
a systematic review and meta-analysis.** 
Obesity reviews, 14(8), 634–44. doi:10.1111/obr.12037

The number of obese young people continues to rise, with a corresponding increase in extreme
 obesity and paediatric-adolescent bariatric surgery. 
 
We aimed to; 

* systematically review the literature on bariatric surgery in children and adolescents
* meta-analyse change in body mass index (BMI) 1-year post-surgery
* report complications, co-morbidity resolution and health-related quality of life (HRQoL)

A systematic literature search (1955-2013) was performed to examine adjustable gastric band, 
 sleeve gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or biliopancreatic diversions operations 
 among obese children and adolescents. Change in BMI a year after surgery was meta-analysed 
 using a random effects model.

In total, 637 patients from 23 studies were included in the meta-analysis.
 There were significant decreases in BMI at 1 year (average weighted mean BMI difference: 
 -13.5 kg m(-2) ; 95% confidence interval [CI] -14.1 to -11.9). Complications were 
 inconsistently reported. There was some evidence of co-morbidity resolution and improvements 
 in HRQol post-surgery. Bariatric surgery leads to significant short-term weight 
 loss in obese children and adolescents. However, the risks of complications are 
 not well defined in the literature. Long-term, prospectively designed studies, with 
 clear reporting of complications and co-morbidity resolution, alongside measures of HRQol, 
 are needed to firmly establish the harms and benefits of bariatric 
 surgery in children and adolescents.
